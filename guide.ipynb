This line is loading a dataset from a file.\n\n2. `df = df.dropna(subset=[\"target\"])`\n   - This line drops (removes) rows from the DataFrame `df` where there are missing values (NaN) in the \"target\" column. It uses the `dropna` method with the `subset` parameter set to \"target\" to specify that it should check for missing values in the \"target\" column and remove rows that have missing values.

When data is removed from a DataFrame, the index labels may have gaps or may not be sequential. This line resets the index to be sequential, starting from 0, and the old index is dropped. The `drop=True` parameter indicates that the old index should be dropped, and `inplace=True` means that this operation modifies the DataFrame in place.\n\n4. `df_shape = df.shape`\n   - This line calculates the shape of the DataFrame `df`, which means it returns a tuple containing the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.

It does this by using the `memory_usage()` method, which returns the memory usage of each column, and then sums these values. The result is divided by 1024^2 to convert it to megabytes.\n\n3. The code then enters a loop that iterates through each column of the DataFrame using the `for col in df.columns:` loop.\n\n4. Inside the loop, it checks the data type of the column using `col_type = df[col].dtype`.\n\n5. If the column's data type is not 'object' (i.e., it's numeric), it proceeds with the optimization.\n\n6. For integer columns:\n   - It checks the minimum and maximum values in the column (c_min and c_max).\n   - Depending on the range of values, it converts the column to the smallest integer data type that can accommodate the data while reducing memory usage. It checks for `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64` data types based on the data range.\n\n7. For float columns:\n   - Similar to integer columns, it checks the minimum and maximum values.\n   - It converts the column to a `float32` data type if the range is within the limits of `np.finfo(np.float32)`. The `np.finfo()` function is used to get the floating-point type's limits.\n\n8. If the column's data type is neither integer nor float and falls outside the specified ranges, it defaults to `float32`.\n\n9. If `verbose` is set to a truthy value (e.g., 1), it provides information about memory optimization, including the initial and final memory usage, and the percentage reduction in memory usage.\n\n10. Finally, the function returns the DataFrame with optimized memory usage.\n\nThis function is useful for reducing the memory footprint of a DataFrame, especially when working with large datasets, by converting columns to the most memory-efficient data types based on the data they contain.

Let's break down each part of the code:\n\n1. `from numba import njit, prange`\n   - This line imports two important features from the Numba library: `njit` for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and `prange` for parallel processing. JIT compilation can significantly speed up the execution of code, and parallel processing allows for concurrent execution of code in a loop.\n\n2. `@njit(parallel=True)`\n   - This is a decorator applied to the `compute_triplet_imbalance` function, indicating that Numba should compile this function for speed optimization and parallel execution. This decorator makes use of Numba's features to enhance the performance of the code.\n\n3. `def compute_triplet_imbalance(df_values, comb_indices):`\n   - This function is designed to calculate triplet imbalance in a parallelized manner using Numba. It takes two parameters:\n     - `df_values`: A NumPy array containing the values of the DataFrame. It represents the price data.\n     - `comb_indices`: A list of combinations of three price indices (a, b, c) for which triplet imbalance needs to be computed.\n\n4. `num_rows = df_values.shape[0]`\n   - This line calculates the number of rows in the `df_values` array, which represents the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n\n5. `imbalance_features = np.empty((num_rows, num_combinations))`\n   - This line initializes an empty NumPy array `imbalance_features` with dimensions (number of rows, number of combinations). This array will store the computed triplet imbalance values.\n\n6. The code then enters a loop that iterates through all combinations of triplets specified by `comb_indices`.\n\n7. `for i in prange(num_combinations):`\n   - This loop is parallelized using `prange`, which allows for multiple combinations to be processed concurrently.\n\n8. Inside the loop, it extracts the indices (a, b, c) for the current combination.\n\n9. Another loop iterates through the rows of the DataFrame (`for j in range(num_rows)`) and calculates the triplet imbalance for each row.\n\n10. `max_val`, `min_val`, and `mid_val` are computed for each row.\n\n11. `if mid_val == min_val:` checks if division by zero would occur and sets the corresponding entry in `imbalance_features` to `np.nan` to prevent errors in such cases.\n\n12. The final imbalance value is calculated using the formula `(max_val - mid_val) / (mid_val - min_val)` and stored in the `imbalance_features` array.\n\n13. The function returns the `imbalance_features` array, which contains the computed triplet imbalance values for all combinations and rows.\n\n14. `calculate_triplet_imbalance_numba` is another function that takes a price column name and a DataFrame as input. It prepares the data and calculates triplet imbalance using the `compute_triplet_imbalance` function. It returns the result as a DataFrame with appropriately labeled columns.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 🏎️ Import Numba for just-in-time (JIT) compilation and parallel processing\nfrom numba import njit, prange\n\n# 📊 Function to compute triplet imbalance in parallel using Numba\n@njit(parallel=True)\ndef compute_triplet_imbalance(df_values, comb_indices):\n    num_rows = df_values.shape[0]\n    num_combinations = len(comb_indices)\n    imbalance_features = np.empty((num_rows, num_combinations))\n\n    #

It prints the current iteration number and the average queries per second (qps) if the counter is a multiple of 10.\n\n15. After processing all test data, it calculates the estimated time cost based on the average qps and prints the estimated time to reason about.\n\nThis code is designed for making predictions in an Optiver trading competition environment and uses a trained LightGBM model for inference. It also includes a transformation step (`zero_sum`) and clipping of predictions to ensure they are within a specified range before submitting them to the competition environment.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def zero_sum(prices, volumes):\n    std_error = np.sqrt(volumes)\n    step = np.sum(prices)/np.sum(std_error)\n    out = prices-std_error*step\n    \n    return out\n\nif is_infer:\n    import optiver2023\n    env = optiver2023.make_env()\n    iter_test = env.iter_test()\n    counter = 0\n    y_min, y_max = -64, 64\n    qps, predictions = [], []\n    cache = pd.DataFrame()\n    for (test, revealed_targets, sample_prediction) in iter_test:\n        now_time = time.time()\n        cache = pd.concat([cache, test], ignore_index=True, axis=0)\n        if counter > 0:\n            cache = cache.groupby(['stock_id']).tail(21).sort_values(by=['date_id', 'seconds_in_bucket', 'stock_id']).reset_index(drop=True)\n        feat = generate_all_features(cache)[-len(test):]\n        lgb_prediction = infer_lgb_model.predict(feat)\n        lgb_prediction = zero_sum(lgb_prediction, test['bid_size'] + test['ask_size'])\n        clipped_predictions = np.clip(lgb_prediction, y_min, y_max)\n        sample_prediction['target'] = clipped_predictions\n        env.predict(sample_prediction)\n        counter += 1\n        qps.append(time.time() - now_time)\n        if counter % 10 == 0:\n            print(counter, 'qps:', np.mean(qps))\n           \n    time_cost = 1.146 * np.mean(qps)\n    print(f\"The code will take approximately {np.round(time_cost, 4)} hours to reason about\")","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":52.710045,"end_time":"2023-10-31T03:55:58.288323","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-31T03:55:05.578278","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-31T12:22:13.837025Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-31T12:22:13.83741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-31T12:23:05.025525Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-31T12:22:13.837383Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-31T12:23:05.024517Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Keep Exploring! 👀\n\nIf you enjoyed exploring this notebook and found it insightful, I encourage you to delve further into my portfolio.\n\n👉 [Explore My Portfolio](https://www.kaggle.com/zulqarnainali) 👈\n\n## Share Your Feedback and Gratitude 🙏\n\nYour feedback is invaluable to us!
